hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha);
hue is a degree of color wheel from 0 to 360, 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black and 100% is white

hexadecimal #rrggbb 0r #rgb (#rrggbbaa or #rgba)
r is red 
g is green

alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (not transparent at all)
